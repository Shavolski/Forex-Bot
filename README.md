# Forex-Bot
A bot that uses simple moving averages to trade currencies in the FX market.

### Before we start..
#### DISCLAIMER! Forex trading carries a heavy amount of risk. Any and everything outlined in this code is for personal purposes only. I am not responsible for any of your losses or any hardships you may face as a result of using this code. Again, this is meant to be used ONLY as a personal fun project.

### How to use..
The bot will require the OandaV20 package along with the Requests package for the project.

An API key from Oanda is also needed so you'll have to create an account in order to gain access to the key and fill in the key and account ID in the init.py file.

Run the code as python app.py in your terminal and you're all set!
